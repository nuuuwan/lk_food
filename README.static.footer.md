### Novo Classification ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·

The Nova classification (Portuguese: nova classificaÃ§Ã£o, 'new classification') is a framework for grouping edible substances based on the extent and purpose of food processing applied to them. Researchers at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, proposed the system in 2009.

Nova classifies food into four groups:

1. Unprocessed or minimally processed foods
2. Processed culinary ingredients
3. Processed foods
4. Ultra-processed foods
