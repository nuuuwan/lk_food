  "description": "Bio-Oil\u00ae Dry Skin Gel is the next generation in the treatment of dry skin. It improves on the existing dry skin technology of creams, lotions, and body butters by replacing the in-active water in these formulations with oil, resulting in a product that is 100% active in treating dry skin. The formulation is delivered in a breakthrough new gel format.\r\nWhen applying a traditional dry skin product, a large quantity needs to be applied as the majority of traditional products, being predominantly water, evaporate when coming into contact with skin. Since Bio-Oil Dry Skin Gel is an oil, substantially less product needs to be used to cover the same body area. Apply a small amount to dry skin as required. In the case of persistent dry skin, apply daily. Bio Oil Dry Skin Gel was specifically formulated as a dry skin treatment for the body, however it may also be used on the face.\r\nBio-Oil Dry Skin Gel is designed to both prevent and treat dry skin conditions. The product may be used as frequently as needed and on an ongoing basis.\r\nFor maximum absorption, Bio-Oil Dry Skin Gel should be applied to cleansed skin after showering. If applying a moisturiser, sun protection lotion or other face cream only do so once Bio-Oil Dry Skin Gel has been completely absorbed into the skin. For all over body use, apply Bio-Oil Dry Skin Gel after showering or bathing. Bio-Oil Dry Skin Gel\u2019s results will vary from individual to individual.",
