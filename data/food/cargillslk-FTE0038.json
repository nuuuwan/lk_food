  "description": "Melons are low in calories and are high in essential vitamins and minerals. They contain almost no fat or saturated fat, making them an excellent choice for snacks or a side dish. They are high in vitamin C, A, Potassium and Lycopene. Vitamin C is an antioxidant vitamin that plays an important role in the growth and maintenance of all tissues in your body. It functions in wound healing and repair of cartilage, bones and teeth. Vitamin A is important for healthy teeth, skin, bone and mucous membranes. It helps the vision system by promoting retinal health. Potassium is an important mineral in the maintenance of heart health. Consuming adequate amounts of potassium in your diet may lower blood pressure and reduce the impact of high-sodium foods. The red color in watermelon is lycopene, a powerful antioxidant that may help prevent cell damage. Lycopene consumption has been linked to reduced rates of certain cancers and a reduced risk of heart attack.
