  "description": "Tamarind is a hardwood tree known scientifically as Tamarindus indica. It\u2019s native to Africa but also grows in India, Pakistan and many other tropical regions. The tree produces bean-like pods filled with seeds surrounded by a fibrous pulp. The pulp of the young fruit is green and sour. As it ripens, the juicy pulp becomes paste-like and more sweet-sour.Tamarind pulp is widely used for cooking in South and Southeast Asia, Mexico, the Middle East and the Caribbean. The seeds and leaves are also edible. It is used in sauces, marinades, chutneys, drinks and desserts. It\u2019s also one of the ingredients of Worcestershire sauce.
