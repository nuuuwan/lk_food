  "description": "Between 1-12 years of age, a child undergoes rapid physical and cognitive development and this needs to be supported by adequate nutritional intake. Ensuring that your child has a complete and balanced diet is crucial. Unfortunately, throughout these growing years, it is common for parents to encounter moments whereby food intake is compromised.
