  "description": "Between 1-12 years of age, a child undergoes rapid physical and cognitive development and this needs to be supported by adequate nutritional intake. Ensuring that your child has a complete and balanced diet is crucial. Unfortunately, throughout these growing years, it is common for parents to encounter moments whereby food intake is compromised. Such moments could be when the child is a picky eater or when he/she falls sick.
