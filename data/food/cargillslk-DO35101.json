  "short_description": "Toothpaste For Dental Hypersensitivity",
  "description": "Dentinal hypersensitivity is a sharp pain produced in the teeth in response to an external stimulus such as cold, heat, sweet, sour, or contact. It affects the quality of life and results in extreme discomfort or inability to eat or drink certain foods. It is caused due to opening of the dentinal tubules after the enamel has been removed by factors such as attrition, abrasion, erosion, or gum recession. RA Thermoseal provides relief from dentinal pain by forming a neurosensory block. Fluoride provides cavity protection. It reduces the demineralization of enamel and dentin by decreasing the acid production of bacterial plaque and decreases the solubility of apatite crystals. It readily becomes incorporated as fluoroapatite layer, to reduce the dissolution of apatite during acid attacks. *Images for illustration purposes only. Product received may vary.",
