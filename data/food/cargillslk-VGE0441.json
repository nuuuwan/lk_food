  "description": "Studies suggest that ginger can protect against age-related damage to the brain. It can also improve brain function in elderly women. Ginger contains a substance called 6-gingerol, which may have protective effects against cancer. However, this needs to be studied a lot more. There is some evidence, in both animals and humans, that ginger can lead to significant reductions in LDL cholesterol and blood triglyceride levels. Ginger appears to be very effective against menstrual pain when taken at the beginning of the menstrual period. Ginger appears to speed up emptying of the stomach, which can be beneficial for people with indigestion and related stomach discomfort.
