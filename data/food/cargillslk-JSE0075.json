Thanks to Kist's unique aseptic packaging technology, Kist buys large quantities of fruits from local farmers during the season and stores them without adding any preservatives to use during the off season. Cargills contributes 50 Cents to a farmer foundation, for each 1kg of fruit and vegetables purchased by Kist for manufacturing it's product range. This is used for a special welfare fund(sarubima Fund) focused on empowering farmer's children through education. *Images for illustration purposes only. Product received may vary.",
