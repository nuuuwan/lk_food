  "description": "Potatoes are rich in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, which make them very healthy. Studies have linked potatoes and their nutrients to a variety of impressive health benefits, including improved blood sugar control, reduced heart disease risk and higher immunity. They may also improve digestive health and combat signs of aging. Potatoes are also quite filling, which means they may help you lose weight by curbing hunger pains and cravings. All in all, potatoes are a great addition to your diet in moderation. They are also naturally gluten-free, which means they can be enjoyed by almost everyone.
