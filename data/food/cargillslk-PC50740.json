  "description": "Pond's pure detox facewash with activated charcoal is a deep cleanser which extracts out pollutants and impurities, leaving skin so pure, it glows. Urban atmospheres are plagued with dust and pollutants that are quite harmful to your skin. These particles settle on your skin and penetrate the surface causing possible long-term damage while also darkening your skin cells from the deep within. This can cause rashes, acne, eczema, dryness, dark spots and even premature aging. *Images for illustration purposes only. Product received may vary.",
