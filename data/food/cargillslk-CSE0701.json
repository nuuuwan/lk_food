  "description": "Sambal Oelek is a spicy Indonesian chili paste made with hot red peppers. Packed full of flavour, this paste is a great condiment. You can also use it as an ingredient in cooked food. Even better, it tastes like you\u2019re cooking with fresh chillies. Stir it into mayonnaise or ketchup, or add it into your salad dressing for that extra kick. *Images for illustration purposes only. Product received may vary.",
