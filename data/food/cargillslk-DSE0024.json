  "description": "Super Heal cream is a topical microbicide active against organisms commonly encountered in skin and wound infections. Super Heal cream enhances wound healing by reducing total and absolute differential white blood cell counts, reducing local infection and inflammation and reducing bacterial expansion and tissue impairment. Super Heal cream is a rich source of natural materials which consist of flavonoids, antioxidants, antibacterial and antifungal ingredients. These affect cytokines production by skin cells when applied topically. Super Heal cream is a product of natural ingredients, therefore causes less irritation to skin and mucous membranes. *Images for illustration purposes only. Product received may vary.",
