  "description": "Bitter gourd is a fruit in the gourd family with a unique appearance and flavor. It\u2019s not only rich in several important nutrients but also linked to numerous health benefits, including improved blood sugar control and cholesterol levels. Note that people who are pregnant or on certain medications \u2014 particularly blood sugar-lowering medications \u2014 should speak to their healthcare provider before consuming high amounts or taking supplements. Still, in moderation, bitter melon makes for a flavorful, nutritious, and easy addition to a healthy, well-rounded diet.
