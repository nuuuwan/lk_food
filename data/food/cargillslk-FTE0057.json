  "description": "There are many reasons to eat citrus fruits. They're nutritious and contain plant compounds that can protect against a variety of diseases, including cancer, heart disease, brain dysfunction and kidney stones. But aim to consume whole fruits, rather than a lot of fruit juice, as its high sugar content can lead to problems. Overall, citrus fruits are healthy, low in calories and convenient to eat. Most people could benefit from adding more citrus to their diet. [Source: www.healthline.com] Disclaimer: Please note that the image is used for presentation purposes only.
