  "description": "Apples are incredibly good for you, and eating them is linked to a lower risk of many major diseases, including diabetes and cancer. What\u2019s more, its soluble fiber content may promote weight loss and gut health. A medium apple equals 1.5 cups of fruit \u2014 which is 3/4 of the 2-cup daily recommendation for fruit. For the greatest benefits, eat the whole fruit \u2014 both skin and flesh. [Source: www.healthline.com] Disclaimer: Please note that the image is used for presentation purposes only.
