  "description": "Kamer`s Fig Jam, made using a traditional recipe with the best figs of the season, has a naturally deep, complex flavour. The flavour profile is so versatile, it goes well with savoury dishes and desserts as well. You can serve it as an appetizer, on top of any creamy cheese, in a grilled cheese sandwich, or our favourite - which is to smear it on hot, buttery toast.*Images for illustration purposes only.
