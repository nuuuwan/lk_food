  "description": "Lurpak\u00ae Unsalted Butter is made from fresh cream and nothing else. It is Lurpak\u00ae in its purest form, and doesn\u2019t contain any salt at all. Lurpak\u00ae Unsalted Butter has a fresh, pure buttery taste and is great for cooking and baking, because it allows you to control the salt level in your food and gives crispier cookies and pie doughs than salted butter. *Images for illustration purposes only.
