  "description": "Kist Mixed fruit Cordial is an exotic combination of fresh tropical fruits which is an ideal thirst quencher for family as well as to be served to visitors with a 1:4 dilution with water. Thanks to Kist's unique aseptic packaging technology, Kist buys large fruit quantities from local farmers during the season & stores without adding any preservatives to use during off season. Cargills contributes 50 Cents to a farmer foundation, for each 1kg of fruit and vegetables purchased by Kist for manufacturing it's product range. This is used for a special welfare fund (Sarubima Fund) focused on empowering farmer's children through education. *Images for illustration purposes only. Product received may vary.",
