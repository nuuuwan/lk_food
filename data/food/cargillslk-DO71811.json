  "description": "Bacterial plaque produces irritants which cause gingivitis and periodontitis ultimately leading to loss of teeth. Chemical control of plaque is achieved effectively with Hexidine. As an antimicrobial, Hexidine prevents secondary infections arising out of poor oral hygiene. It is particularly useful in plaque control. Hexidine begins its microbicidal effect in 15 seconds after contact and its bacteriostatic action lasts for 12 hours. *Images for illustration purposes only. Product received may vary.",
