Grounding it into paste, then sun dried, shaped into blocks, and allowed to ferment again. The resulting blocks are chalky and only slightly moist. Belacan has a pungent smell and taste. It is always toasted and used in small quantities to give a savory depth of flavor to traditional dishes that are widely used in South East Asia. *Images for illustration purposes only.
