  "short_description": "Danish Blue Cheese",
  "description": "The cheese is made using cow\u2019s milk and displays fine streaks of blue veins along its white interior. Resembling Danish royal porcelain, it enchants with tones of mild bitterness and salt. The flavors are pungent and sharp, with a creamy and smooth texture on par with many soft cheeses. *Images for illustration purposes only. Product received may vary.",
