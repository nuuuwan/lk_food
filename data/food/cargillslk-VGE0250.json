  "description": "Sweet potatoes are nutrient-dense root vegetables that come in a variety of colors. They\u2019re high in fiber and antioxidants, which protect your body from free radical damage and promote a healthy gut and brain. They\u2019re also incredibly rich in beta-carotene, which is converted to vitamin A to support good vision and your immune system. Sweet potatoes are versatile and can be prepared in both sweet and savory dishes, making them an exceptional carb option for most people.
