It\u2019s easy to grow or find at most natural food stores. Animal and laboratory research has shown that lemongrass has anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticancer properties. Lemongrass may also help protect your stomach lining and improve your lipid profile. Many lemongrass studies were done using lemongrass essential oil, not lemongrass tea. More human studies are needed using lemongrass tea to confirm the health benefits of lemongrass. You shouldn\u2019t self-treat any condition with lemongrass tea or use it in place of your prescribed medications without your doctor\u2019s approval.

There is some evidence, in both animals and humans, that ginger can lead to significant reductions in LDL cholesterol and blood triglyceride levels. Ginger appears to be very effective against menstrual pain when taken at the beginning of the menstrual period. Ginger appears to speed up emptying of the stomach, which can be beneficial for people with indigestion and related stomach discomfort.
